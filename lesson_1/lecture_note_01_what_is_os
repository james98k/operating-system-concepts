os 를 구성함에 있어서 processor - memory 를 연결하는 bus 가 중요하다. 

processor recives instruction data -> update memory -> update pc to execute

setup memory and give the address of the memory to the processor-> automated functions are called

storing information persistently

=====================

technical issues?
1. portability issue (hardware-dependency)
-> hard to write a code that works for all computer

2. interoperatability issue

3. scheduling issues

4. recource management issue (efficiency and scalability)

5. safety & security issues


===========================
Approach
-virtualize a computer system
ex) for all computer program, giving a virtual computer system solves problem
provide a consistent and simple view to applications and programmers

-provide common interfaces for an application program to communicate with hardware 
units and other application programs (for interoperatibility)

underneath the virtualization, we can control the hardware resources

utilizing many virtual computer recourses 

process is a small virtual computer


===============================
pipelining
